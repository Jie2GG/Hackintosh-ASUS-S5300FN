<p class="dropDownBody">The HTML report gives you an alternative method for viewing the dumps.</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">Enabling this option instructs another shell script to run once all the dumps have completed. It scans the latest dump folder in DarwinDumperReports and constructs an HTML report file, including as much of the dumped information as possible.</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">You now have the option of choose between a new style report as well as the classic style report, either open of collapsed.</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">The difference with the new style report is it now utilises the standard jQuery and jQueryUI libraries with the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/accordion/" target="_blank">accordion</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/tabs/" target="_blank">tabs</a> widgets currently being used. Adopting this approach will make it easier to add other features in the future.</p>
