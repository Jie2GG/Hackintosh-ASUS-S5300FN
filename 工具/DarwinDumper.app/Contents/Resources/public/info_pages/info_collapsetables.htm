<div id="helpTitleBar"><label class="dropDownTitleText">Information: Collapse Tables</label></div>
<p class="dropDownBody">The HTML report displays each dump section in it's own div and these divs can be set to visible (expanded) or hidden (collapsed).</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">Viewing a complete dump report with hidden divs makes the report easier to view, though if you're only dumping a couple of items then maybe leaving them visible would be beneficial.</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">The collapsed option sets the divs to hidden.</p>
