<p class="dropDownBody">If running on OS X El Capitan and earlier, an attempt is made to find an Apple System Log for the last day the system was booted. If found, the last boot log from that day is dumped for a file named Kernel_Messsages_BootLog.txt in the latest dump/BootLog_Kernel directory.<p>
<p class="dropDownBody">The command used to read the file is syslog -f /var/log/asl/&lt;FILE&gt;</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">If running on OS X Sierra onwards, the kernel boot messages from the last boot are extracted from the new logging system. The log is saved to a file named Kernel_Messsages_BootLog.txt in the latest dump/BootLog_Kernel directory.<p>
