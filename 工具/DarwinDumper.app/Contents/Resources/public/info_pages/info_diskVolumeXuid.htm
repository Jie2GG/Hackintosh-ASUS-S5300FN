<div id="helpTitleBar"><label class="dropDownTitleText">Information: Disk Volume GUID and UUID</label></div>
<p class="dropDownBody">These take the format of: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">This dump option runs a shell script which uses the system diskutil tool to read the Volume UUID of each mounted partition. This UUID is the only accurate way to refer to a device as OS X does not guarantee to assign the same device id to the same disk at each boot. This value can be used, for example, in a kernel flag when booting your system: rd=uuid boot-uuid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">The script also extracts the unique partition GUID property for each disk identifer (for example, disk1s3) from the IORegistry. These will only be present on a disk using a GUID partition table. This value can be used, for example, for hiding volumes in Clover's config.plist.</p>
<p class="dropDownBody">The information from this dump option is saved to a file named UIDs.txt in the latest dump/BootSectDump folder.</p>
